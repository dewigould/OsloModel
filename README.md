# OsloModel

Two codes submitted: 
- Results.py
- oslo.py

Oslo.py is the bulk of the code, contains all my methods/ algorithms etc. Results.py is a simple script which contains each task, split up into sections. By simply setting Boolean values = True, you can obtain the graphs required for each section.

There are multiple parameters that have been set in Results.py already, so that the code runs quickly for ease of visualisation (eg. the script is pre-programmed to run for smaller L just so that you can quickly obtain the same results I got, without having to wait for ages). But if you do want to check it for larger L, you can just change the parameters in the functions.
